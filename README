An experiment in creating a Sinatra OAuth Provider.

Start the app with "ruby app.rb" and use it to create a message or two and a new consumer oauth application. When created, add the shared key and secret to the keys.rb file. Run "ruby request.rb" to get the authorization url and request token and secret. Add the request token and secret to the keys.rb file. Authorize your app. Then run "ruby access.rb" to get your access token and secret, and to keys.rb as well. Finally with your access tokens you can run "ruby query.rb" to call the API.

Requires:
Sinatra: http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/tree/master
OAuth for Ruby: http://github.com/pelle/oauth/tree/master
OAuth Provider for Ruby: http://github.com/halorgium/oauth_provider/tree/master

Since the oauth_provider does not have a gem yet.
In the project:
  mkdir lib
  cd lib
  git clone git://github.com/halorgium/oauth_provider.git
