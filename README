An experiment in creating a Sinatra OAuth Provider, Consumer and API wrapper.

To run the provider:
	ruby provider.rb
	Go to http://localhost:4567/

To run the consumer:
	ruby consumer.rb -p 5678
	Go to http://localhost:5678/
	
Requirements and Installation
  Sinatra: http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra
		sudo gem install sinatra

  OAuth for Ruby: http://github.com/pelle/oauth
		sudo gem install oauth

  OAuth Provider for Ruby: http://github.com/singpolyma/oauth_provider
		Since there is no gem yet you will need to do the following:
  		cd lib
  		git clone git://github.com/singpolyma/oauth_provider.git

Thanks to pelle, halorgium (for auth_provider), and singpolyma (for the simple Sinatra example and provider fix)! And to the Vancouver "Ruby in the Rain" event for opening my eyes to Sinatra. You guys rock!

Enjoy!
